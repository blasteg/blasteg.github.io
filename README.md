# La-Mulana Tracker

This tracker uses the [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) system.

Usage: 
1. The entrance matching next to the itemgrid is for your memory aid, has no implication on what happens on the map. Left/right click to find the pairing. Feedback to enhance the icons is highly appreciated.
(Example: You start at Surface, going into the transition to the right, finding Tower of Ruins,you left/right click on the "Surface to Guidance" icon to cycle through possible entry, to match it with "Ruins to Illusion" icon)

2. On the Map, Entrances are treated as item locations. When you find a new Entrance, right click on it to claim that location so the tracker knows. 
(Example: You start at Surface, going into the transition to the right, finding Tower of Ruins, you should right click the Tower of Ruins entrance on the map so the tracker knows you have access to it)

3. An Alternative Set of Transition Icons is available in "image/Composing_Transition2", change it to "Composing_Transition" and the original to whatever else to use them.

FAQ/ Known issue:
1. Logic requires both having subweapon and access to ammo for it to be in logic, left/right click for weapon/ammo.
2. Right click the woman statue to get Fertility statue.
3. Yagomap, Yagostr and Shrine Map is condenced into a "place bone x/3" icon, increment it when you find one of them by cicking it.
